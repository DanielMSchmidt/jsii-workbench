# JSII Workbench

When working with JSII you sometimes just want to drop in an interface and inspect all generated code in differnet languages.

## Usage

1. Run `npm install`
2. Open `./src/index.ts` and add your library code
3. Open `./example.ts` and add your user-facing code
4. Run `npm build` 


You can view the generated library bindings at `./generated/` and the user facing example at `./EXAMPLE.md`.
